# 0x0D Web Stack Debugging 0

## Overview

This directory is part of the web stack debugging series, aimed at training you to master the art of debugging web stacks. The primary focus is on practical, hands-on experience in identifying and resolving common issues encountered with web servers, specifically within Dockerized environments.

## Objective

The main goal of this project is to debug a Docker container configured to run an Apache web server. The server must serve a page containing the text "Hello Holberton" when accessed. The initial setup presents a scenario where accessing the server does not yield the expected output, and your task is to diagnose and fix the underlying issues.

## Task

- **Give me a page**: You are provided with a Docker container that should be serving a page via Apache. However, upon accessing the server, it does not display the expected "Hello Holberton" message. Your mission is to enter the container, investigate the configuration, and implement a fix to ensure the server behaves as intended.
