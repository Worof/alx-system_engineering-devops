# Postmortem Report

## Issue Summary

**Date:** August 5, 2024  
**Duration:** 10:00 AM - 12:30 PM GMT  
**Impact:** Approximately 60% of users experienced significant delays in data retrieval and timeouts, which disrupted normal service operations.  
**Root Cause:** A misconfigured database replication factor during routine maintenance led to an overload on the database servers.

## Timeline

- **10:00 AM:** High latency and timeout alerts from database monitoring tools.
- **10:05 AM:** Incident escalated to the Database Administration Team.
- **10:20 AM:** Initial assumption of a traffic spike dismissed after traffic analysis.
- **10:50 AM:** Investigation redirected towards internal database configurations.
- **11:10 AM:** Identification of incorrect replication settings as the primary issue.
- **11:45 AM:** Implementation of correct replication settings.
- **12:00 PM:** Gradual restoration of database performance.
- **12:30 PM:** Full system recovery and closing of the incident.

## Root Cause and Resolution

The root cause was traced to a misconfiguration in the database replication settings applied during the last maintenance update. This misconfiguration created an excessive load on the database, leading to high latency and timeouts. The issue was resolved by resetting the replication factor to its optimal setting and closely monitoring the system to ensure stability.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures

To prevent similar incidents in the future, the following measures are being implemented:

- **Review and Revise Maintenance Protocols:** All maintenance procedures will now include a mandatory verification phase for system configurations.
- **Enhanced Monitoring Tools:** Upgrade monitoring systems to automatically detect and alert any deviation in critical database parameters.
- **Emergency Training for Database Team:** Conduct quarterly emergency response trainings for the database team focusing on quick identification and rollback of problematic changes.

### Task List

- [ ] Develop and implement configuration verification tests post-maintenance.
- [ ] Upgrade database monitoring tools by Q4 2024.
- [ ] Schedule the first emergency procedure training session for Q1 2025.
