# Port Forwarding Configuration for web-01

This document outlines the steps taken to configure port forwarding from port 8080 to port 80 on the web-01 server using UFW.

## Changes Made

1. **IP Forwarding Enabled**:
   - Modified `/etc/ufw/sysctl.conf` to enable IP forwarding.
   - Added line: `net/ipv4/ip_forward=1`.

2. **UFW Before Rules Updated**:
   - Added NAT rules to `/etc/ufw/before.rules` to redirect port 8080 to port 80.
   - Rules added:
     ```
     *nat
     :PREROUTING ACCEPT [0:0]
     -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 8080 -j REDIRECT --to-port 80
     COMMIT
     ```

## Applying Changes

- Changes were applied by reloading UFW using the command:
  ```bash
  sudo ufw reload
