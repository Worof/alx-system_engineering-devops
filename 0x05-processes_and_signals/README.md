# Project: Processes and Signals

## Description

This project contains a series of Bash scripts related to the management and handling of processes and signals in a Unix-like environment. Each script is designed to demonstrate a specific concept or command related to process management in Unix/Linux, particularly as it applies to Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
## Requirements

- All scripts must be written in Bash and tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
- Scripts should be executable and must follow best practices and standards for Bash scripting.
- Each script should start with the shebang `#!/usr/bin/env bash` and include a comment describing its functionality.
- All files must end with a newline.
- The code should pass Shellcheck (version 0.7.0) without any errors.

## Usage

Each script can be executed from the command line. For example:

```bash
./0-what-is-my-pid
