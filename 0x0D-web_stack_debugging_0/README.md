# 0x0D Web Stack Debugging 0

## Overview

This directory contains the necessary files and scripts used for the first project in the web stack debugging series. The main goal of this project is to introduce basic debugging techniques on a web stack.

## Description

In this project, we focus on debugging a simple web stack scenario where an Apache server is expected to serve a specific page. The debugging process involves ensuring that the Apache server is running and configured correctly to serve a "Hello Holberton" page.

## Requirements

- All files are interpreted on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
- All Bash scripts are executable (`chmod +x script_name`)
- Bash scripts pass `Shellcheck` without any error
- The first line of all your Bash scripts should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/env bash`
- The second line of all your Bash scripts should be a comment explaining what the script is doing

## Files and Descriptions

1. **0-give_me_a_page:** Bash script that configures an Apache server to serve a page containing "Hello Holberton".

## How to Use

To use the scripts in this directory, first ensure they have execute permissions:

```bash
chmod +x 0-give_me_a_page
